# SOLID
Simple app that follows the SOLID principles:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.


To run it clone the repo and run `ruby main.rb` on your terminal.
